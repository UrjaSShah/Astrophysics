# Astrophysics Codes

This repository contains a collection of astrophysics-related codes developed as part of coursework. The scripts cover both data analysis and visualization, with a focus on fundamental problems in astrophysics.

âš¡ Features

- Clean, modular Python implementations
- Uses standard scientific libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, astropy

ðŸŽ“ Academic Context

These codes were written for coursework in astrophysics and computational physics. While not production-level software, they provide a foundation for learning, experimentation, and extension to research projects. NOTE : Some of these have been done in collaboration with peers.
